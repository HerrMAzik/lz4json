A little utility to unpack lz4json files as generated by Firefox's bookmark backups and session restore.
This is a different format from what the normal lz4 utility expects.
The data is dumped to stdout.

Requires liblz4 (Debian package liblz4-dev, Fedora package lz4-devel) to be installed.

lz4jsoncat ~/.mozilla/.../bookmarkbackups/bookmarks-2014-12-27_151_0UCIWGB4x3hhQXpuSMs5WQ==.jsonlz4 

On some non Linux systems the lz libraries might be installed into directories
that are not searched by the linker by default. If that's the case
please override the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS on the command line

e.g. if they are in /usr/local:

make CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -O2" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib"
